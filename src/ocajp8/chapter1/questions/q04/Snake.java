//Given the following class, which of the following is true? (Choose all that apply)
// A. If String result = "done"; is inserted on line 2, the code will compile. (correct, it will compile)
// B. If String result = "done"; is inserted on line 4, the code will compile. (correct, it will compile)
// C. If String result = "done"; is inserted on line 6, the code will compile.
// D. If String result = "done"; is inserted on line 9, the code will compile.
// E. None of the above changes will make the code compile.


/*
 * 4. A, B. Adding the variable at line 2 makes result an instance variable.
 * Since instance variables are in scope for the entire life of the object,
 * option A is correct. Option B is correct because adding the variable at line
 * 4 makes result a local variable with a scope of the whole method. Adding the
 * variable at line 6 makes result a local variable with a scope of lines 6â€“7.
 * Since it is out of scope on line 8, the println does not compile and option C
 * is incorrect. Adding the variable at line 9 makes result a local variable
 * with a scope of lines 9 and 10. Since line 8 is before the declaration, it
 * does not compile and option D is incorrect. Finally, option E is incorrect
 * because the code can be made to compile.

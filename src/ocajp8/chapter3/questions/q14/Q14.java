	 * A, C. The reverse() method is the easiest way of reversing the characters in a StringBuilder; 
	 * therefore, option A is correct. Option B is a nice distractionâ€”it does in fact
	 * return "avaJ". However, substring() returns a String, which is not stored anywhere.
	 * Option C uses method chaining. First it creates the value "JavavaJ$". Then it removes
	 * the first three characters, resulting in "avaJ$". Finally, it removes the last character,
	 * resulting in "avaJ". Option D throws an exception because you cannot delete the character after the last index. Remember that deleteCharAt() uses indexes that are zero
	 * based and length() counts starting with 1.
